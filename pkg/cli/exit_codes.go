// recordExportFailure folds a failed export into a command's named return, so a

// It used to be invisible. Every per-format failure printed to stderr and
// stopped there, so a scan whose -o directory was unwritable exited 0, emitted
// `scan.finished status=completed` on the --events stream, and left zero bytes
// behind — three independent success signals for a run that produced no output.
// A driver reading the machine interface could not tell that apart from a clean
// scan with no findings.
//
// A failure already in flight wins, because the export most likely failed
// BECAUSE the scan did and the cause is the more useful thing to report. That
// deliberately includes the --fail-on gate and --fail-on-match, which are
// completed results whose premise is that the output was written first: both are
// layered on by the CALLER (withFailOnGate in runScanCmd, outside the defers
// that run this), so an export failure recorded here is already the `prior` that
// withFailOnGate yields to. The precedence lives there, in one place; do not
// re-derive it here.
//
// Exit code and machine code come from the coded error, which classifyExitCode
// maps to ExitError and classifyErrorCode reports as errCodeExportFailed.
//
// The exporters print nothing themselves — the root handler renders whatever
// error a command returns, so printing there too said the same thing twice. That
// leaves exactly one case where a failure would otherwise vanish: when an
// earlier error wins and this one is dropped. It is printed here, and only here.

// source_missing — which tells a driver the database it just read successfully
