// `traffic -j` and `finding -j` could only ever write to stdout, so a result
// large enough to matter had to travel through whatever was driving the CLI —
// a shell capture, a tool transcript, an agent's context — even when the caller
// only wanted it on disk to grep later. `db export` and `export` have had -o for
// exactly this reason; the browse commands did not, and the gap was the whole
// difference between "save this" and "print this and hope".
//
// Scoped to --json on purpose. A table rendered to a file is `export`'s job and
// already has formats, filters and a summary; adding a second, quieter spelling
// of it here would be a parallel export path to keep in sync.
