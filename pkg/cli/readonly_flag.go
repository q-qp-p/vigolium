// directory, sets the journal_mode PRAGMA (which rewrites the file header) and
// runs an unconditional wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE) — so a plain
// `traffic -S --db evidence.sqlite -j` changed that file's SHA-256, flipped it
// from `delete` to `wal`, and dropped -shm/-wal siblings beside it. A file marked
// `chmod 444` could not be read at all.
//
// That is fine for the working project database, which vigolium owns. It is not
// fine for a `.sqlite` handed over as evidence, a per-run export being read after
// the fact, or anything under chain of custody, where the artifact must survive
// the read byte-identical.
//
// --read-only is a separate axis from -S/--stateless, which is a *scoping* mode
// ("ignore project boundaries in this file") and never implied immutability
// despite reading like it might.

// thing this flag exists to prevent. Subcommands that are genuinely read-only
