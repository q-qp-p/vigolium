// --max-output-bytes caps the size of a -j result document.
//
// A read command's page size is counted in ROWS (-n/--limit), and rows vary in
// size by three orders of magnitude: twenty findings with no bodies is a few
// kilobytes, twenty traffic records with --full-body is tens of megabytes. A
// caller with a byte budget — an agent with a context window, a CI step with a
// log limit, an HTTP handler piping the result — has no row count that reliably
// stays under it, because the only way to learn the size is to produce it.
//
// So the cap is applied where the size is known: after rendering, before
// emitting. It truncates at a RECORD boundary and reports what it dropped, so
// the document stays valid JSON and the caller learns there is more rather than
// receiving a prefix of a broken one.
//
// It is opt-in and unlimited by default (triage C8: a default has to be
// measured before it is chosen). Nothing changes for a caller that does not
// pass it.

// budget enforced against an estimate is a budget that is sometimes exceeded.
// That makes each measurement a full encode, so the search is a binary one:
// ~log2(n) encodes rather than n.
//
// Total is deliberately left alone. It describes the result set, not the page,
// and leaving it is what makes resultIsPaged and the -o receipt report
// `complete:false` for a budgeted document — the same way they already do for a
// row-limited one.
