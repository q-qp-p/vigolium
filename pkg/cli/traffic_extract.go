// `traffic body` and `traffic headers` extract ONE part of ONE stored exchange.
//
// Everything they do was previously reachable, and that was the problem: getting
// a single response body onto disk meant `db export --format fs`, which writes a
// whole tree (and whose -o names a directory PREFIX, so `-o ./out` produces
// ./out-traffic/…), then finding the file inside it. The listing's own
// decoder_hint said to do exactly that. Meanwhile reading just the response
// headers had no spelling at all: --fields response carries the body with them.
//
// So the gap is narrow and so are these: one record, one side, bytes out. The
// decoding, capping, hashing and completeness rules are NOT reimplemented here —
// they are the same gunzipBounded/splitHeadersBody the JSON views use, which is
// the point. A body extracted here and a body previewed by `traffic -j` are the
// same bytes by construction.

// Extraction flags. Separate vars from the listing's: these subcommands share
// trafficCmd's persistent filter flags but own their selection.
