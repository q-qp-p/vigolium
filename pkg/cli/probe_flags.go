// rejecting a bad value with a usage error, and answering "did the operator
// type it" — a question only cobra can answer.

// Deliberately NOT the `export` command's topExportOnly. That global is read by
// streamExportData for EVERY format - html, report, pdf, sarif, bundle and the
// stateless console dump all stream through the same gate - so writing it here
// made `run probe -o report.html --format html` render a report with its
// findings silently removed. A flag that documents itself as narrowing the jsonl
// envelope has to reach only the jsonl envelope.
var scanExportScope = fullExportScope

// applyExportScope resolves which record types this run's jsonl envelope carries.
//
// An explicit --export-only always wins. Otherwise a probe-only run defaults to
// http records alone, because on that run the two envelope types are the same
// information twice: the only modules a sweep runs are the 26 fingerprint ones
// (whose findings are all "Technology Detected: X") and surface-scoring (which
// emits nothing), and the fingerprint verdict now lands on the record itself in
// http_records.technology. Emitting both doubles the file to restate what the
// record already says.
//
// Any other run keeps the full envelope: a real scan's findings are not
// derivable from its records, so narrowing there would silently drop results.
//
// The probe default is resolved here rather than in runner.ApplyNativePhaseSelection
// (where applyProbeOnlyDefaults lives) because it governs a CLI-only output path:
// the REST API and the programmatic launcher never reach streamExportData, so
// there is no second caller for the two to disagree about.
