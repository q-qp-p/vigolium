// Every -j read attaches a ready-to-run follow-up command:
//
//	"query": "vigolium finding --id 5 --json --with-records"
//
// and every one of them was generated without the context that made the read
// reachable. Finding IDs are per-database autoincrement integers and traffic
// UUIDs are per-store, so following that string from a session pinned to
// `--db /engagements/acme.sqlite -S` opens the DEFAULT database instead and
// returns a different row with the same id, or nothing. The envelope already
// reports db_path and project_scoped; the follow-up it printed contradicted
// both.
//
// A glob merge is worse: `--glob-db '*.sqlite'` reads through a temporary
// database that is deleted when the process exits, so a follow-up naming it
// cannot be reopened by anyone, ever.
//
// readContextArgs generates the flags that reproduce the current read, and
// followUpQuery composes them with a command. The display string stays a
// display string — correctly quoted, but nobody should have to eval it.

// readContextArgs returns the flags that pin a follow-up read to the same store
// and scope as the read that produced it.

//     into. OpenedDBPath reports the scratch file, which is deleted on exit.
//   - A non-SQLite driver has no path. OpenedDBPath returns the driver name
