// beginScanEventStream installs the process event emitter for this scan and
// writes the opening scan.started line.
//
// The emitter is installed AFTER the scan uuid is pinned and the DB is open, so
// scan.started can carry the two facts a consumer most needs to attribute later
// events: which scan row this is, and which database it landed in. Everything
// before that point is setup that fails loudly on its own.
//
// The terminal event is returned as TWO functions because the facts it carries
// become available at two different moments, and a single deferred call could
// only ever be right about one of them:
//
//   - prepare reads the totals and the coverage verdict, and must run while the
//     database is still open — which is before the --db-isolate merge copies
//     the run into the real store.
//   - emit writes the line, and must run after everything that can still fail
//     has failed. A merge that cannot write is a failed scan, and the stream
//     used to say `completed` because its terminal event had already gone out.
//
// Deferred in that order (emit registered first, so LIFO runs it last), the
// line reports what prepare measured and the status the whole invocation
// earned.
